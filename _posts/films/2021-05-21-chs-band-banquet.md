The end-of-year band banquet for the Centennial High School Band program.

<hr>

I was tasked with creating a banquet video to replace the normally in-person event. Over two weeks, I recorded the director, created graphics, and put together a picture slideshow. The end result was an 18 minute video that was shared amongst band families to celebrate the accomplishments of the students through the year.
