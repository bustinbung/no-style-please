A short film shot and edited in two weeks. The prompt was

> Everybody wants to rule the world

<hr>

We ran into some issues when the SD card containing most of the footage was lost. Luckily, there was some source media and proxy clips in the trash of the computer I was editing on, so we could recover a majority of the film. We did lose an important scene, so it isn't the most cohesive story ever. However, I'm still proud of the cinematography.
